# Action recognition (detection) based on RNN

### Overall Objective:

- Training, validating, testing RNN models (with LSTM cells) using data from open-source video datasets.

- Make the model give reasonable descriptions with word or sentence when it's
  fed with new videos.


### File Structure

./rnn\_practice: 
    For doing some practice on RNN models and LSTMs with online tutorails and
    other great resources.

./data:
    Training and testing data. (**But don't add huge data files to this repo**)

./model:
    Defining the model and other training/testing details

./utils:
    Possible utils scripts
